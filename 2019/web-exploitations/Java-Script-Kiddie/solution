Riiight, I spend some time at this one. 
Finally I've dug some info about PNG file and found that there is always same header in place. 
Each PNG file starts with: 137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10 0 0 0 13 73 72 68 82
That info allowed me to move on. I wrote the code and realized that each line has 16 bytes and that means that
there file was 16 bytes long and 45 height? (:))  
I've editied the script and added some code that gave me all possibile values at each possition that
can shift the "bytes" to match PNG header. I ended up with those, and thankfully one of them worked: 
4549618515012495
4549618516012495
4549618517012495
4549618515112495
4549618516112495
4549618517112495
4549618525012495
4549618526012495
4549618527012495

4539618517012495

4539618525112495
4539618526112495
4539618527112495

TBH, there was more values at each possition that could work, for example at 1st I could use "a" and that would works also
That's because some ascii values after modulo 48 (hardcoded magic number) gives same "shift". Example:
a -> ASCII: 97 -> 97 modulo 48 = 4
4 -> ASCII: 52 -> 52 modulo 48 = 4
