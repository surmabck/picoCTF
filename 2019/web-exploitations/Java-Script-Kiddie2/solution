Second version of that png decoding was fairly easy. 
This time the key is 32 char long, and only numbers are allowed because at some point, value is being casted to number. 
We can easly understand how does key elements extracting works. It simply ignores key characters that are on even position. 
Also, my code from previous Java-Script-Kiddie works ;) 
Therefore I've used my code and ignored even positions (Put 0 on each) and ended with the key: 000080508060900003000105001801050
